Use modern tools and techniques to develope modern assets.

Complie css with SASS

The layout is up to you... we'll be doing a class build that communicates the idea (hopefully) 
the idea / goal is to click on an image, trigger a fetch call to a database and then populate that data on the page 
in technical terms. the layout can be as simple or complex as you like

so the issue with that build was that you tried to use a template.
 you don't really need to do that - you can select the elements directly with querySelector and change their textContent properties
we did that in week 2 or 3 with a JavaScript object, which is really all you're doing when you get the data back
so for the prof name, just querySelector("#some class or id")
and then profName.textContent = data.profname
something like that

    1- Sleeping

    3- Reading
